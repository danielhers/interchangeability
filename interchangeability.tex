    \begin{abstract}
    We investigate the extent to which word embedding models
    preserve interchangeability, as reflected by distances between
    word vectors, and the effect of hyperparameters---context window size in particular.
    We use part-of-speech (POS) as a proxy for interchangeability,
    considering words to be interchangeable if they have the same POS.
    We also investigate the relationship between interchangeability
    and similarity as judged by commonly	 used word similarity benchmarks,
    and correlate the result with the performance of word embedding models
    on these benchmarks.
    \end{abstract}

    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

    Word embedding models attempt to capture the semantic space of words
    in a metric space of real-valued vectors.
    While it is common knowledge that the hyperparameters used to train these
    models affects the semantic properties of the distances arising from them
    \cite{goldberg2016primer}, we are not aware of prior work quantifying the
    relation between specific semantic relations and model hyperparameters.
    In this work, we begin to answer this question.
    As a test case, experiment with the word2vec CBOW model
    \cite{mikolov2013efficient}, taking context window size as a hyperparameter,
    and look at interchangeability of words as a semantic relation.
    Although many semantic relations are captured by WordNet
    \cite{yang2006verb,agirre2009study},
    we interpret interchangeability for this work as having the same part-of-speech
    (POS).
    
    Word embedding models often start by extracting co-occurrences from a text
    corpus, and then perform learning on the extracted co-occurrence matrix
    (either by training a neural network to predict words based on their neighbors,
    as in word2vec, or by performing some manipulation,
    such as dimensionality reduction, to the co-occurrence matrix).
    Co-occurrences are often extracted by finding, for each word token, all
    words within a constant-size window around that word (or a randomly-sized
    window up to a certain maximal size, as in word2vec).
    The size of the window (or the maximal size)
    is a hyperparameter referred to as the \textit{context window size}.

    Our experiments reveal that context window size is negatively correlated
    with the presence of same-POS words in the 50 nearest neighbors of words
    according to an embedding model using that context window size.
    
    Our code is available\footnote{\url{https://github.ibm.com/DANIELH/sib}}.
    
    \section{Word Embedding Model}\label{sec:model}
    
    We train a 300-dimensional word2vec CBOW model using a context window size of
    3, 5, 10, 15 and 50, on a corpus comprising of all articles in English Wikipedia.
    To calculate the similarity between words, we use cosine similarity
    between their corresponding vectors.
    From these models, we pre-calculate the top 50 nearest neighbors for
    each of the 1K words in the vocabulary, taken as the 1K most common
    words in the corpus.
    
    
    \section{Interchangeability in Nearest Neighbor Lists}\label{sec:nn}
    
    As a first experiment, we measure the proportion of same-POS words
    within the list of nearest neighbors for each word in our vocabulary.
    
    \subsection{Collecting Pivots}\label{sec:pivots}
    
    We create word lists for the most
    common parts of speech: nouns, adjectives and verbs.
    For each POS, we list all lemmas of all synsets of that POS from
    WordNet,\footnote{A possible alternative would be to start with the 1K
    vocabulary, use spaCy to tag the POS for each of these unigrams,
    and construct the lists this way.
    However, this would not allow us to remove polysemous words with more
    than one possible POS.}
    and remove from the list any lemma that also belongs to a synset from
    another POS.
    This gives us a list of \textit{uniquely-noun}, \textit{uniquely-adjective}
    and \textit{uniquely-verb} words.
    
    Filtering each of these lists to leave only words that are in
    the 1K vocabulary (see~\S\ref{sec:model}) results in three lists,
    which we refer to as the \textit{pivot lists}.
    They contain 543 nouns, 35 adjectives and 38 verbs, respectively
    
    \subsection{Nearest Neighbor Analysis}\label{sec:nn_analysis}
    
    Using our pre-calculated nearest neighbor lists, we create, for each
    POS, a list of word pairs: for each word in the corresponding pivot list,
    we take its 50 nearest neighbors, and add each one along with the pivot word
    as a (pivot, neighbor) pair.
    
    For each of these lists of pairs, we use spaCy\footnote{\url{https://spacy.io}}
    to tag the POS of the neighbor word in each pair.
    While the spaCy POS-tagger supports tagging word sequences that are longer
    than one word, using it for each of the words separately is likely
    to assign each words its most commonly used POS.
    
    We subsequently calculate a histogram, for each POS $x$, of its
    \textit{neighbor-POS} $y$, that is, the POS assigned to the neighbors of
    words with POS $x$.
    
    \subsection{Results}\label{sec:nn_results}
    
    Figure~\ref{fig:nn_pos_hist} shows the results of this experiment.
    For nouns, adjectives and verbs, we consistently see a decrease in
    the number of same-POS neighbors when we increase the window size,
    while other neighbors are increasing or unaffected.

    \section{Interchangeability in Word Pair Benchmarks}\label{sec:benchmarks}

    Many benchmarks have been proposed for the evaluation of unsupervised word
    representations.
    In general, they can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods~\cite{schnabel2015evaluation,jastrzebski2017evaluate,alshargi2018concept2vec,bakarov2018survey,chiu2016intrinsic}.
    While most datasets measure the semantic similarity between words,
    many datasets actually capture semantic relatedness
    \cite{hill2015simlex,avraham2016improving},
    or more complex relations such as analogy or the ability to categorize
    words based on the distributed representation encoded in word embeddings.
    We focus on similarity and relatedness, and evaluate interchangeability
    of related pairs in the following benchmarks:
    
    \paragraph{Similarity.}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MTurk-287~\cite{radinsky2011word}
        \item MTurk-771~\cite{halawi2012large}
        \item WordSim-353~\cite{finkelstein2001placing}
        \item RG65~\cite{rubenstein1965contextual}

        \item SimVerb-3500~\cite{Gerz2016emnlp}
%        \item YP-130~\cite{yang2006verb}
%        \item MC-30~\cite{miller1991contextual}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \paragraph{Relatedness.}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MEN~\cite{bruni2012distributional}
        \item WordSim-353-Rel~\cite{zesch2008using}
%        \item TR9856~\cite{levy2015tr9856}
%        \item WORT~\cite{eindor2018semantic}
    \end{itemize}

%        \item Google~\cite{mikolov2013distributed}
%        \item SemEval 2012 task 2~\cite{jurgens2012semeval}
%    \end{itemize}
%    
%    \paragraph{Categorization.}

%        \item AP~\cite{almuhareb2005concept}
%        \item BLESS~\cite{baroni2011we}
%        \item Battig~\cite{battig1969category}
%    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Relatedness Threshold}\label{sec:threshold}
    
    While all of these benchmarks assign a score along a scale to each pair
    (calculated from human scoring), for our experiment we would like to use
    a binary annotation of whether a pair is related or not.
    For this purpose, we divide the whole range of scores,
    for each benchmark, to three parts:
    the lowest 30\% of the range between the lowest and highest scores
    is considered ``unrelated'', the top 30\% as ``related'',
    and the middle 40\% are ignored.
    
    \subsection{Benchmark Analysis}\label{benchmark_analysis}
    
    Given the binary classification obtained from the human-annotated scores
    for each benchmark, we can find the enrichment of same-POS pairs among
    related pairs.
    Again, we use spaCy to annotate the POS for each word in each benchmark
    pair (tagging them in isolation to select the most probably POS),
    and look at the set of same-POS pairs in the benchmark.
    For each of the benchmark, we calculated a p-value using the hypergeometric
    test, comparing the enrichment of same-POS pairs within related pairs,
    with a background of all related and unrelated pairs (ignoring ones in
    the middle 40\% range of scores).
    
    \subsection{Results}\label{sec:benchmark_results}
    
    \begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|cc|cc|c}
    \hline

    SimVerb3500 & 3500 & 633 & 265 & 1217 & 566 & 0.974
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Analysis of interchangeability (by same-POS) in
    word similarity and relatedness benchmarks.
    \label{tab:benchmark_results}}
    \end{table}
    
    Table~\ref{tab:benchmark_results} shows the results of this experiment.
    For WordSim353, MEN and MTurk287, the set of related pairs
    contains significantly more same-POS pairs than the background set.
    
    In SimLex999 and in SimVerb3500, all pairs are same-POS by design:
    in SimVerb all words are verbs, and in SimLex every pair is of the same POS.
    The fact that not all pairs in these benchmarks are judged as same-POS
    in our experiment is due to ambiguity: for some words, spaCy selected a POS
    which is not the one intended in constructing the benchmark.
